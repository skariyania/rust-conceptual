# Rust Learning
> learning rust by reading rust programming book and implementing concepts everyday
- Contains small practical and working examples.

- I have started reorganizing project structure to recommended standards, however it may take some time to complete.

- I will be also updating all the other links, tools that I have used in upcoming week 


### More about this repository
- I started this project with tutorials directory, those are very first rust programs I wrote.
- Later on while learning, I found better way to organize cargo. Hence other part of the repo is in workspace and it contains well organized source.
- project requires refactoring tutorials directory, yet pending. I will complete it eventually.
- Workspace directory includes small working examples
- book directory is also having small projects created earlier, this will be moved inside workspace in next week.
- This repo is also a good example of how to organize project structure in any rust repo using cargo.
- most of the exercises and tutorials in this repository is prepared by learning rust programming language book available [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). I highly recommend this reading. It was worth investing time in learning rust with this book.
- I thought It would be good idea to share my version of summary highlights, [refer this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12HvD1PUefYbPreYAWpNl-x05AP7QW-4n/view?usp=drive_link) to quickly summarize.
- I am yet exploring easy ways to extract highlights from PDF to md or text format, for your ease of reading.

### Crates.io
- Crates.io is official rust package registry.
- similar to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for node.js, [pypi](https://pypi.org/) for python and [packages](https://pkg.go.dev/) for golang
- When I was learning rust, I have created and published working crate. [check my crates](https://crates.io/users/skariyania). you will also learn how to create and publish your crate during course of reading the book

>Reach out to me for any feedback, I appreciate. Happy Learning
